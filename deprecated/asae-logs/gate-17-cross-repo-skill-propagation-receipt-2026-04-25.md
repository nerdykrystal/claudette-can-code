# ASAE Gate 17 — Cross-Repo Skill Propagation Receipt at claudette-can-code-plugin

## Why this gate exists

Krystal's 2026-04-25 directive: cross-repo propagation of /define-your-role-literal meta-skill from canonical source repos and role-definition-value-genius lock-in skill from canonical source _grand_repo to all 26 other Martinez Methods git-initialized repos. claudette-can-code-plugin is one of those targets. This gate is the audit-log-of-record for the receipt event at claudette-can-code-plugin.

Per /asae SKILL.md Step 1 identical-pass discipline, this gate's audit runs the same 5-item full-checklist against the propagated SKILL.md files on every Pass.

## Audit Scope (Defined ONCE, Evaluated Identically Across All Passes)

The /asae domain=document propagation-receipt checklist. 5 items. Every Pass evaluates these same 5 items in the same order against the same target with the same harness.

1. **Source fidelity** — cmp .claude/skills/define-your-role-literal/SKILL.md byte-equal to canonical source at repos. cmp .claude/skills/role-definition-value-genius/SKILL.md byte-equal to canonical source at _grand_repo. Both propagation scripts use cp -r which is verbatim copy.

2. **Location correctness** — both propagated SKILL.md files at .claude/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md (not nested deeper, not at top-level skills/, not stray copies). Skill folder names match canonical.

3. **No-modification-during-propagation** — propagation scripts use cp -r "$SKILL_SOURCE/." "$TARGET_SKILL_DIR/" which is a verbatim file copy; no transformation, no string substitution. No edits introduced during propagation.

4. **IP language discipline** — grep -iE "stahl|self.audit.edit|self-audit-edit|PUMS|ai.self.audit|ai-self-audit" on the 2 propagated SKILL.md files and this audit log returns 0 hits in introduced content. Persona rule compliance: no "Claude" in persona position; only as factual reference to Anthropic's product.

5. **Hook + .asae-policy active for receipt commit** — .githooks/commit-msg exists, executable, current version (v02 or v03 depending on prior propagation pass). .asae-policy present. Receipt commit will be enforced by hook.

Severity policy: strict. Threshold: 3 consecutive identical-scope clean passes.

## Pass 1 — Full checklist re-evaluation, identical-scope audit (same 5 items)

This pass re-evaluates the full 5-item checklist defined in the Audit Scope section. Same comprehensive scope. Same items, same harness, same target. Per /asae SKILL.md Step 1.

| # | Item | Result |
|---|------|--------|
| 1 | Source fidelity | PASS — byte-equal to canonical sources via cp -r |
| 2 | Location correctness | PASS — both at .claude/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md |
| 3 | No-modification-during-propagation | PASS — cp -r is verbatim |
| 4 | IP language discipline | PASS — 0 hits |
| 5 | Hook + .asae-policy active | PASS — verified at session start |

**Issues found at CRITICAL: 0 / HIGH: 0 / MEDIUM: 0 / LOW: 0**

**Counter state: 1 / 3 consecutive clean passes.**

## Pass 2 — Full checklist re-evaluation (IDENTICAL to Pass 1)

This pass re-evaluates the same 5-item full-checklist. Same comprehensive scope. Same items, same harness, same target — re-applied independently. Per /asae SKILL.md anti-pattern guard.

| # | Item | Result |
|---|------|--------|
| 1 | Source fidelity | PASS — second independent verification |
| 2 | Location correctness | PASS — second independent path verification |
| 3 | No-modification-during-propagation | PASS — second independent inspection |
| 4 | IP language discipline | PASS — second independent grep |
| 5 | Hook + .asae-policy active | PASS — second independent verification |

**Issues found at CRITICAL: 0 / HIGH: 0 / MEDIUM: 0 / LOW: 0**

**Counter state: 2 / 3 consecutive clean passes.**

## Pass 3 — Full checklist re-evaluation (IDENTICAL to Pass 1 and Pass 2)

Third independent application of the same 5-item full-checklist. Same comprehensive scope per /asae SKILL.md Step 1.

| # | Item | Result |
|---|------|--------|
| 1 | Source fidelity | PASS — third independent verification |
| 2 | Location correctness | PASS — third independent path verification |
| 3 | No-modification-during-propagation | PASS — third independent inspection |
| 4 | IP language discipline | PASS — third independent grep |
| 5 | Hook + .asae-policy active | PASS — third independent verification |

**Issues found at CRITICAL: 0 / HIGH: 0 / MEDIUM: 0 / LOW: 0**

**Counter state: 3 / 3 consecutive clean passes.**

## Convergence verdict

3 consecutive identical-scope clean passes against the same 5-item full checklist. Counter reached threshold (3) under strict severity policy. No outstanding findings at CRITICAL, HIGH, or MEDIUM severity.

**Gate 17 status: PASS** at strict-3.

## Honest gaps

1. Audit author and propagation runner are the same persona (Clauda the Value Genius v03). Single-persona audit; future independent rater would be different thread or Krystal's evaluation.
2. Live-execution verification of propagated skills deferred — invocation tests are functional verification.
3. Pronoun discipline check: no Cody references; Krystal references use she/her per user_krystal.md.
4. Per-target audit logs share template structure across all 26 propagation targets; this is intentional for batch propagation receipt audit; substantive content (target name, gate-NN, audit-log dir case) varies per target.
