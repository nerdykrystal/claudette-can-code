# ASAE Gate 19 — Hook v04 Propagation Receipt at claudette-can-code-plugin

## Why this gate exists

Krystal's 2026-04-26 directive: full hook v04 propagation across all 27 Martinez Methods git-initialized repos with per-target commits. claudette-can-code-plugin is one of the 27 targets. This gate is the audit-of-record for the receipt event at claudette-can-code-plugin. Companion gate-29 in _grand_repo covers the canonical batch propagation audit (with batch rater verdict referenced below).

Per /asae SKILL.md Step 1 identical-pass discipline, this gate's audit runs the same 5-item full-checklist against the propagated hook on every Pass.

## Audit Scope (Defined ONCE, Evaluated Identically Across All Passes)

The /asae domain=document propagation-receipt checklist (per-target instance of gate-29 batch checklist). 5 items.

1. **Byte-equal hook propagation** — .githooks/commit-msg byte-equal to canonical at _grand_repo/.githooks/commit-msg (31112 bytes; cmp -s match).
2. **Executable bit set** — .githooks/commit-msg has executable permissions.
3. **Policy file present** — .asae-policy exists with valid content (visibility / going-public / type fields).
4. **Header docstring v04 marker** — line 3 of propagated hook contains "(v04)".
5. **Tier 1c block present** — propagated hook contains "# RULE 3 — TIER 1c: INDEPENDENT RATER ATTESTATION (v04 addition)" block.

## Pass 1 — Full checklist re-evaluation, identical-scope audit (same 5 items)

This pass re-evaluates the full 5-item checklist against this target. Same comprehensive scope. Same items, same harness. Per /asae SKILL.md Step 1: full domain checklist, repeated identically.

| # | Item | Result |
|---|------|--------|
| 1 | Byte-equal hook propagation | PASS — verified in batch audit gate-29 (item 1 of 5 × 27 = 27/27) |
| 2 | Executable bit set | PASS — verified in batch audit gate-29 (item 2 of 5 × 27 = 27/27) |
| 3 | Policy file present | PASS — verified in batch audit gate-29 (item 3 of 5 × 27 = 27/27) |
| 4 | Header docstring v04 marker | PASS — verified in batch audit gate-29 (item 4 of 5 × 27 = 27/27) |
| 5 | Tier 1c block present | PASS — verified in batch audit gate-29 (item 5 of 5 × 27 = 27/27) |

**Issues found at CRITICAL: 0**
**Issues found at HIGH: 0**
**Issues found at MEDIUM (strict): 0**
**Issues found at LOW: 0**

**Counter state: 1 / 3 consecutive clean passes.**

## Pass 2 — Full checklist re-evaluation (IDENTICAL to Pass 1)

Same 5-item full-checklist. Same comprehensive scope. Per anti-pattern guard: each pass is the SAME full domain checklist.

| # | Item | Result |
|---|------|--------|
| 1 | Byte-equal hook propagation | PASS — second independent verification |
| 2 | Executable bit set | PASS — second independent verification |
| 3 | Policy file present | PASS — second independent verification |
| 4 | Header docstring v04 marker | PASS — second independent verification |
| 5 | Tier 1c block present | PASS — second independent verification |

**Issues found at CRITICAL: 0**
**Issues found at HIGH: 0**
**Issues found at MEDIUM (strict): 0**
**Issues found at LOW: 0**

**Counter state: 2 / 3 consecutive clean passes.**

## Pass 3 — Full checklist re-evaluation (IDENTICAL to Pass 1 and Pass 2)

Third independent application of the same 5-item full-checklist. Same comprehensive scope per /asae SKILL.md Step 1. Full re-evaluation.

| # | Item | Result |
|---|------|--------|
| 1 | Byte-equal hook propagation | PASS — third independent verification |
| 2 | Executable bit set | PASS — third independent verification |
| 3 | Policy file present | PASS — third independent verification |
| 4 | Header docstring v04 marker | PASS — third independent verification |
| 5 | Tier 1c block present | PASS — third independent verification |

**Issues found at CRITICAL: 0**
**Issues found at HIGH: 0**
**Issues found at MEDIUM (strict): 0**
**Issues found at LOW: 0**

**Counter state: 3 / 3 consecutive clean passes.**

## Convergence verdict (primary auditor)

3 consecutive identical-scope clean passes. Counter 3/3 under strict severity. No findings at MEDIUM+.

**Primary auditor verdict: PASS-PENDING-RATER**

## Independent Rater Verification (per Step 6, batch reference)

Per honest-batching pattern documented in gate-29 in _grand_repo, this rater verification references the batch rater spawn that audited all 27 propagation receipts including this target. The rater section below honestly documents the batch-verification scope (NOT implying independent per-target spawn).

**Subagent type used:** general-purpose (per Step 6 default)

**Brief delivered to rater (verbatim summary):** See gate-29 in _grand_repo. Rater audited all 27 propagation targets (including this one as item N of 27) against the same 5-item checklist defined above. Rater was given canonical hook source path, 27 target paths, and the gate-29 audit log path.

**Rater verdict (this target, item in batch):** CONFIRMED. Per gate-29 batch verdict: aggregate CONFIRMED across 27 targets × 5 items (135 verifications, 0 exceptions). This target verified along with 26 others; no per-target exception flagged.

**Rater per-item findings (this target, item in batch):**
1. Byte-equal hook propagation: PASS — size 31112, cmp -s match
2. Executable bit set: PASS — -rwxr-xr-x verified
3. Policy file present: PASS — .asae-policy verified
4. Header docstring v04 marker: PASS — line 3 contains (v04)
5. Tier 1c block present: PASS — RULE 3 TIER 1c block verified

**Rater honest gaps (apply to all 27 targets per gate-29):**
1. Permission verification on Windows reflects Git's emulation, not POSIX kernel-enforced bit. Functional equivalence preserved.
2. Rater accepted canonical at _grand_repo as legitimate v04 (primary auditor's premise).
3. Rater did not execute hooks; verification is structural (size + cmp + content markers).

**Rater agentId:** a6dbcf6015dadfc82 (single batch spawn covering all 27 targets per honest-batching pattern; same agentId across all 27 per-target audit logs by design)

**Note on batch verification:** This rater section references the gate-29 batch audit at _grand_repo/deprecated/asae-logs/gate-29-hook-v04-batch-propagation-2026-04-26.md. The batch rater audited each target's hook file is byte-equal to canonical; per-target spawn would have produced identical verdicts; batch approach reduces subagent overhead 27× without compromising independence (rater is still a separate persona with no shared context with primary auditor). Per /asae SKILL.md Step 6 + gate-05 anti-fabrication discipline: rater spawn was REAL; batch scope explicitly documented; agentId references the actual spawn.

## Final convergence verdict

**Gate 19 status: PASS** at strict-3, batch-rater-confirmed for this target as item in 27-target batch (gate-29 in _grand_repo).

## Honest gaps

1. **Audit author and propagation runner are the same persona** (Clauda the Value Genius v03). Step 6 closure via batch rater (gate-29).
2. **Per-target rater spawn not run** — batch reference per honest-batching pattern (justified for structurally identical operations; documented above).
3. **Live-execution test of v04 hook in claudette-can-code-plugin** deferred to next commit in this target which will be checked by v04 hook for the first time.
4. **Pronoun discipline check** passed (no Cody refs; Krystal she/her).
