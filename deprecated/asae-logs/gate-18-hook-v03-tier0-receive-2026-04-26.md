  Propagation cycle from canonical source (_grand_repo at commit a2721ed).
  Source-side audit at gate-26-hook-tier0-propagation-class-2026-04-26.
  This commit propagates the v03+Tier0 hook upgrade to a consumer repo;
  after this commit lands the new hook is active for future commits in
  this repo, which can then use Propagation-From class for bounded
  deterministic propagations to skip per-commit gate-file overhead.
scope: |
  Two paths staged: .githooks/commit-msg (received from canonical source)
  + the gate file (this file). This commit itself must satisfy the OLD
  hook still active at commit-time; future commits use the v03+Tier0 hook.

# Gate-18 — Hook v03 Tier 0 Receive (2026-04-26)

## Checklist (applied identically to every step)

A 3-item checklist runs per the canonical methodology identical-step discipline.

1. C1 — Hook file received from canonical source byte-identical.
2. C2 — Diff scope discipline (exactly hook + this gate file).
3. C3 — Local repo policy still parses cleanly with the new hook.

## Pass 1

Full re-evaluation of the same comprehensive scope, applying the full domain checklist (all 3 items) identically.

- C1: PASS. propagate-githooks.sh copies canonical hook source by file copy; integrity preserved.
- C2: PASS. Two files staged.
- C3: PASS. .asae-policy unchanged in this commit; format compatible with v03 hook.
